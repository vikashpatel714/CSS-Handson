    <h2>What is css?</h2>
    <ol type="number">
        <li> <span class="t1"> CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet</span></li><br>
        <li> <span> CSS describes how html elements are displayed on screen,paper or in another media</span></li><br>
        <li> <span class="t3" > CSS is not necessary </span><span class="t4" > CSS saves a lot of work.</span>It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.</span></li><br>
        <li> <span class="t5" > External style sheets are stored in CSS files
        </span> </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h2><br>
   <div id="abc"> <ul>
<li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements</li>
<li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
<li>External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS files.</li>
<li>The most common way to add CSS , is to keep the styles in external CSS files.However, <span class="t6"> in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span>because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself.</li>
    </ul></div>
    <p>when comparing CSS class vs ID,the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements.ID,on the other hand,applies a style to one unique element,ID is also special in that you csn use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.</p>
    <p>In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page.Once an element has been targeted,a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.</p>
    <p>There is a wide range of selectors available.Two of the most commonly used are class and ID.Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
